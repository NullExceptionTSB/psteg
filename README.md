Versatile steganographic software, written in C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2)

**DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF MY CONTROL, I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT PULL REQUESTS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE**

**THIS PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY STILL UNDERGOING ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT, THE SOURCE CODE NEEDS SERIOUS REFACTORING WORK. DO NOT TRUST THIS WITH ANY IRREPLACABLE DATA**

It should also be noted that the release is **severely** outdated. If you want a working version, you'll have to build from source.

Also please note that the source code is currently very poor due to tight deadlines. It will be improved in the future.
